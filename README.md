#Assignment

This assignment was to complete the Javascript code so that the user can run a random password generator. The generator was to include options for upper and lowercase letter, also numbers and special characters. I was able to use alot of knowledge gained from unit 3 but also had the opprotunity to learn a few new things on my own.
